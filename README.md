# Final-Year-Project
This study focuses on understanding the social influence on businesses through social media, where it aims to discover the most apt social media platform based on the organization’s business objective through clear-cut analysis. Moreover, the study’s secondary objective is to discern the correlation between demographics and the popularity of a social media platform through interesting groups and patterns discovered. These will be done by applying congruous methodologies when dealing with the mixed-data dataset whilst deploying clustering analysis to identify hidden patterns and clusters within the dataset.
